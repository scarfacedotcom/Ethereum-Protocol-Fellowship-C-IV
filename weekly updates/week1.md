# Introduction:

Hello everyone! I am Adaaku Peter, and I am thrilled to be a part of the Ethereum protocol fellowship. My focus during this fellowship is on the Execution Layer, EVM, Crypto, Merge, and working with Geth. This progress report covers my activities and achievements during the first week of the fellowship.

## Week 1 Highlights:

Orientation and Reading List: I attended the fellowship's orientation session, where I gained a clear understanding of the fellowship's objectives and expectations. I received the reading list, which includes essential resources for building a strong foundation in the target areas.

* [Etheruem Yellow Paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf)
* [Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)]( https://eips.ethereum.org/)
* [Geth Documentation](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/)

## Challenges Faced:

While I made significant progress during the first week, I encountered a few challenges:

Technical Complexity: The Ethereum ecosystem is vast and intricate, which can be overwhelming for beginners. Understanding concepts like the EVM and Crypto requires careful reading and research.

Navigating GitHub: The vastness of the Geth GitHub repository made it challenging to find specific issues that match my interests. I need to improve my GitHub search skills to target relevant topics effectively.

## Plan for Next Week:

To overcome the challenges and make steady progress, my plan for the next week is as follows:

Continue Ethereum Yellow Paper: I will continue reading the Ethereum Yellow Paper, focusing on the EVM's operational semantics and its interactions with the Execution Layer.

Hands-on with Geth: I aim to set up Geth on my local machine and run some basic commands. This will give me practical exposure to Geth's functionalities and help me gain confidence in navigating the codebase.

Engage with Community: I plan to actively engage with the Ethereum developer community, participating in discussions, asking questions, and seeking guidance from experienced developers.

Identify Contribution Opportunities: I will further explore the Geth GitHub repository to identify specific issues or features where I can make meaningful contributions.

## Conclusion:

The first week of the fellowship has been both exciting and challenging. I am thrilled to be part of this journey, and I am eager to continue my exploration of the Ethereum ecosystem.I am confident that I will gain the knowledge and skills needed to become a proficient Ethereum protocol developer.
