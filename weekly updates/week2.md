Greetings again, fellow developers! :wave:

TL;DR

I'm delighted to provide you with a glimpse into my progress throughout Week 2 of the Ethereum Protocol Fellowship Cohort 4.

### What I Achieved This Week


* This week has been all about diving deep into the technical aspects of Ethereum. I immersed myself in extensive documentation, exploring various Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), dissecting technical implementations, and ultimately committing to working with Go Ethereum.

* Engaged in daily stand-up meetings on 24/07, fostering collaboration and staying updated with the team's progress.

* I started Conducting a comprehensive review of the Ethereum yellow paper, enhancing my understanding of the underlying protocol.

### Educational Pursuits

* I invested time in broadening my knowledge by watching Mario's enlightening video: "Understanding Ethereum's Inner Workings." The insights gained from this video furthered my comprehension of Ethereum's intricate mechanisms.

* I delved into the intricate details of the Geth documentation, immersing myself in the codebase of Go Ethereum. This hands-on experience allowed me to gain insights into the inner workings of Geth.

## Exploration Beyond Geth

Beyond Geth, I also explored the documentation of Prysm and Lighthouse, two other significant Ethereum consensus clients. I ventured into trying out the implementations of these clients, giving me a well-rounded perspective of the Ethereum ecosystem.

i was able to sync both clients and interact with them

By examining these projects' pull requests (PRs) and consulting development resources, I have been preparing myself for active contribution. This includes familiarizing myself with the development books associated with these projects.

#### Troubleshooting and Beyond

In the process, I encountered and addressed some issues while running Lighthouse on the Goerli testnet. This hands-on experience not only exposed me to real-world challenges but also honed my problem-solving skills.

#### Project Exploration

I embarked on an exploration of various project ideas proposed within the fellowship. Although I couldn't dive into all of them due to time constraints, I aimed to understand the scope and implications of each project. This exploration will guide my decision-making process in selecting a project to work on.



### Looking Ahead to Week 3

In the upcoming week, I plan to finalize my decision on a project to contribute to. Furthermore, I am eager to connect with a mentor to discuss a more substantial implementation plan once I feel confident navigating the codebase.
